# hello
## To solve this classification problem using **Bayesian Classification**, we'll calculate probabilities and classify an unknown fruit as "Apple" or "Orange" based on its **Color** and **Size**.

---

### **Dataset Summary**
| **Fruit** | **Color** | **Size** |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Apple     | Red       | Small    |
| Apple     | Red       | Large    |
| Orange    | Orange    | Small    |
| Orange    | Orange    | Large    |
| Apple     | Red       | Small    |

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Priors**  
The prior probabilities are the probabilities of each class (Apple or Orange) in the dataset.

- Total number of fruits = 5  
- **P(Apple)** = (Number of Apples) / (Total number of fruits)  
  **P(Apple)** = 3 / 5 = 0.6  
- **P(Orange)** = (Number of Oranges) / (Total number of fruits)  
  **P(Orange)** = 2 / 5 = 0.4  

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods**  
We compute the likelihoods of **Color** and **Size** for each class.

#### For Apple:
- **P(Color = Red | Apple)** = (Number of Red Apples) / (Total Apples)  
  **P(Color = Red | Apple)** = 3 / 3 = 1.0  
- **P(Color = Orange | Apple)** = (Number of Orange Apples) / (Total Apples)  
  **P(Color = Orange | Apple)** = 0 / 3 = 0.0  
- **P(Size = Small | Apple)** = (Number of Small Apples) / (Total Apples)  
  **P(Size = Small | Apple)** = 2 / 3 â‰ˆ 0.67  
- **P(Size = Large | Apple)** = (Number of Large Apples) / (Total Apples)  
  **P(Size = Large | Apple)** = 1 / 3 â‰ˆ 0.33  

#### For Orange:
- **P(Color = Red | Orange)** = (Number of Red Oranges) / (Total Oranges)  
  **P(Color = Red | Orange)** = 0 / 2 = 0.0  
- **P(Color = Orange | Orange)** = (Number of Orange Oranges) / (Total Oranges)  
  **P(Color = Orange | Orange)** = 2 / 2 = 1.0  
- **P(Size = Small | Orange)** = (Number of Small Oranges) / (Total Oranges)  
  **P(Size = Small | Orange)** = 1 / 2 = 0.5  
- **P(Size = Large | Orange)** = (Number of Large Oranges) / (Total Oranges)  
  **P(Size = Large | Orange)** = 1 / 2 = 0.5  

---

### **Step 3: Classify an Unknown Fruit**
Suppose we are given an **unknown fruit** with **Color = Red** and **Size = Small**.  
We calculate the posterior probabilities for each class using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(Class | Features) = \frac {P(Features | Class) \cdot P(Class)}{P(Features)}
\]

Since \(P(Features)\) is the same for both classes, we only need to calculate the numerator.

#### For Apple:
\[
P(Apple | Features) \propto P(Color = Red | Apple) \cdot P(Size = Small | Apple) \cdot P(Apple)
\]
\[
P(Apple | Features) \propto 1.0 \cdot 0.67 \cdot 0.6 = 0.402
\]

#### For Orange:
\[
P(Orange | Features) \propto P(Color = Red | Orange) \cdot P(Size = Small | Orange) \cdot P(Orange)
\]
\[
P(Orange | Features) \propto 0.0 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.4 = 0.0
\]

---

### **Step 4: Classification**
Since \(P(Apple | Features) > P(Orange | Features)\), the unknown fruit is classified as **Apple**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The fruit is classified as **Apple**. Let me know if you'd like a breakdown of another classification scenario! ðŸ˜Š
